# Ralsei.exe
## DO NOT DOWNLOAD BEFORE READING THIS
**This is a joke virus made in Godot Engine that you can use to troll you friends.** __It does no damage or leak any data, it's made to scare people who open it__

**! IF YOU WANT TO RECORD AND PUBLISH VIDEO OF THIS, USE VPN OR BLUR EVERY INFO THE VIRUS DISPLAYS !**

## How do I close it?
App can be closed only when window is shaking, just press ESC and wait 3s. You shouldn't be able to close it using task manager because window is always  being moved to foreground.
```
OS.move_window_to_foreground()
```
## How does it work?
First it pings a website http://myexternalip.com/raw to get IP adress. Then it runs many commands in cmd such as `systeminfo`, `ipconfig` to get system information and then reads the output.

After it's done on top of the screen displays your IP adress in rainbow colors and under it all system information with smoking Ralsei from Deltarune (yes).
The window shakes and you can't close it by clicking X or using alt + f4

## Is it dangerous?
No, it's made to scare you, this is why I call it "joke virus". Even if it displays your IP adress and system info it's not being send anywhere.
__IMPORTANT NOTE:__ I don't recommend downloading copies or forks of this repository, because it maybe actually harmful. 

## Why did you make this "virus"?
Cause I was bored.
